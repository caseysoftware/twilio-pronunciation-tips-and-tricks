Twilio Pronunciation Tips & Tricks
=====================================

English is a messy language. There was no architect, it changes over time, and is entirely inconsistent.

We have acronyms that we spell - FBI, CNN, UN - and acronyms that we say: NASA, NATO, SCUBA.

Countries are even more challenging as some pronunciations are somewhat subjective.

Then we have homonyms which are words that are spelled differently but pronounced the same: they're, their, bare, bear, etc.

Then we have heteronyms which are words that are spelled the same but pronounced differently: project (as in speak loudly), project (as in a set of tasks), object (as in be in opposition), and object (an item).


This project is an effort to test the Twilio Text to Speech engine through a number of the above scenarios both in context and out of context of day to day usage.

If you have more words & phrases to test, pull requests are welcome.
